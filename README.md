# Towards a Geometric Notion of Financial Market Volatility
## COMS 4995 Geometric Data Analysis
This project proposes a geometric notion of representing market volatility. It operates by projecting price data to the Wasserstein space and finding the distance of a given point to a rolling barycenter as measure of volatility.

The repository intentionally omits files that are required for running the project to prevent complete duplication. However, the key ideas are presented in the report.
